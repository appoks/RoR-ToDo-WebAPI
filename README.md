## ðŸ’» About this Project

This RESTful API was built using Rails 6. It requires postgres for both development and deployment. The development follows RoR with TDD workflow as with creating tests to fail, implementing the desired feature and running tests again to verify if all tests are correctly passing.

You can create a user, perform the login and logout operation (authentication is built with JWT.) and interact with two types of resources: ToDos and Items. A ToDo can have many Items.
